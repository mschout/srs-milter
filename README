      srs-milter - SRS filter module

Sendmail includes a facility for plugging in custom mail filters,
called milters.  It's documented here: http://www.milter.org/milter_api/

This milter is intended as a SRS filter for rewriting incoming/outgoing
mail envelope addresses to fix forwarding problems caused by SPF.

For usage run `srs-milter --help`
